                <h4>Need for Machine Learning</h4><br>

The need for machine learning is increasing day by day. The reason behind the need for machine learning is that it is<br> 
capable of doing tasks that are too complex for a person to implement directly. As a human, we have some limitations<br> 
as we cannot access the huge amount of data manually, so for this, we need some computer systems and here comes<br> 
the machine learning to make things easy for us.<br>

We can train machine learning algorithms by providing them the huge amount of data and let them explore the data,<br> 
construct the models, and predict the required output automatically. The performance of the machine learning <br>
algorithm depends on the amount of data, and it can be determined by the cost function. With the help of machine<br>
learning, we can save both time and money.<br>

The importance of machine learning can be easily understood by its uses cases, Currently, machine learning is used in<br> 
self-driving cars, cyber fraud detection, face recognition, and friend suggestion by Facebook, etc. Various top<br>
companies such as Netflix and Amazon have build machine learning models that are using a vast amount of data to<br> 
analyze the user interest and recommend product accordingly.<br>
